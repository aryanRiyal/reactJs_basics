JSX (JavaScript XML(Extensible Markup Language))
Components
    Consistency: React components must return a single element.
    Structure: A single parent element helps organize and group child elements.
    Flexibility: Using div, section, or React.Fragment allows for easier styling and layout control.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
Props
    For Example:   ./components/TodoItem.jsx - {props.completed ? <></> : <input type='checkbox' />}
                                ./App.js - <TodoItem completed='true' text='Code' />
Hooks
    LifeCycle of a Component
        Constructed -> Mounted -> Updated -> Unmounted
    useState Hook
        Whenever the value of the state changes, the component re-renders itself with updated value(means every use of function to set the value will re-render the whole component again and again)
    useEffect Hook
        Run code during the change in lifecycle of a component
