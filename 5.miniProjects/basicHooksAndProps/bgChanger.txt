/* Draft Explanation - onClick() for detailed explanation view ../onClickExpectations.txt
onClick expects a function so if we give a reference to onClick its fine like onClick(setColor) works but we can't pass a value to the function. onClick(setColor('Red')); here we are calling the function setColor() with the value 'Red' so it will execute first and returns the value, but the problem is that onClick expects a function not the result so it is a syntax problem. So we have to use a callback and then call the setColor('Red')
onClick(() => setColor('Red')); this is the reason we use callback inside the onClick()
